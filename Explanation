I used the decision tree, in order to classify the mushrooms for the binary classification. This was the best way instead of a scatterplot or bar graph because the data was not numbers, it was either poisonous or non, so the decision tree was the best one to do. As it acts like a flowchart in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute, making more sense for data that does not have numbers and more categorical. It also shows the various outcome and was the most efficient for the research analysis. The main goal of decision tree is to achieve perfect classification with minimum number of decision and with so many categories for the mushroom, this algorithm was the most perfect. I first had to split my data between each column because of the multiple categories, (attributes) and input each data for jypiter notes. After my first time using java and jypter notes, I actually had a lot of fun, learning new concepts like today, because in the beginning I found it challenging to use scatter points, so I found a way around it. I'm glad I manage to capture an experience like this and hope to continue to look into ACM projects and even more challenges.
